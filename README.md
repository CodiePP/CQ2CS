# CQ2CS - Courageous Solutions to Challenging Questions

## What

I collect here a number of questions that merit a deeper investigation. That's an impulse, then a dedication.

## Why

There are big questions having a big impact on our lifes, that's why they are BIG. I want this repo to be a loose collection of such questions and challenge me to find answers which provide solutions.

## How

Science has shown to be a good tool to derive knowledge and serve as a common language.

The format is HTML with minimalistic Javascript to make the texts multilingual (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, ...)

## You

You may open _issues_ or _pull requests_ for submitting small corrections. If you plan to submit your own findings and conclusions, then bear in mind that I may include or ignore your submission.
